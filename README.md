# Linear Regression from scratch using Ordinary Least Squares

- This repo demonstrates the working of Linear Regression from scratch using OLS.
- It compares the results obtained from various methods to solve least squares problems and sklearn's linear regression.
- It also contains math intuition of linear algebra concepts like Singular Value Decomposition, Pseudo-inverse, QR decomposition used in solving OLS.
